# BEMT - Blade Element Momentum Theory

Implementation of Blade Element Momentum Theory and case study for Aerodynamics of wind turbine and rotating blades (AA-204) course. 
This project implements the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT), which is a technique used to calculate the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines and propellers.

# Hanson's Method
Implementation of Hanson method to predict tonal noise of rotating blade using Actuactor Line Simulation inputs and BEMT inputs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher

### Using `Poetry`

If you're using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies, follow the instructions below to set up the environment.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Install ``Poetry`` if you don't have it installed:
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment generated by ``Poetry``:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```
### Using `pip`
If you prefer to use pip directly, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install the dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml` file:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy==2.1.1 matplotlib==3.9.2 ipykernel==6.25.5 pathlib2==2.3.7.post1 scipy==1.14.1 pandas==2.2.2 nbformat==5.4.0
    ```

### Usage
- The main project file is ``case.ipynb``, where you can run the code related to the BEMT implementation.
- Use Jupyter Notebook to open and execute the simulations and calculations.
